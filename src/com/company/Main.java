// Anesh Turk Project #1
// Data Structures and Algorithms CS 3345
// Fall 2019 - Due 9/29/19

/*
    The purpose of this project is to compare the efficiency of the following 6 sorting algorithms:
        1. Insertion Sort
        2. Selection Sort
        3. Quick Sort
        4. Merge Sort
        5. Heap Sort
        6. Radix Sort

    On arrays which already exist in the following states:
        1. InOrder (ascending)
        2. ReverseOrder (descending)
        3. AlmostOrder (80% sorted 20% unsorted)
        4. Random

    We will be keeping track of the number of comparisons, element movements, and the running time and will then compare
        the results between them
